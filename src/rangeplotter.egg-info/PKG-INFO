# RangePlotter

**Simple large-radius viewshed and visibility  analysis**

RangePlotter is a command line, python-based geospatial utility designed to calculate accurate large-radius sensor coverage maps for visualisation in an appropriate viewer (such as Google Earth). Unlike pure geometric tools, RangePlotter integrates high-resolution (30m) global terrain data (Copernicus GLO-30) to determine exactly where a sensor can see, accounting for Earth curvature, atmospheric refraction, and terrain masking (viewsheds).

## Use Cases

*   **Radar Network Visualisation**: Optimize site selection by visualizing coverage gaps and terrain shadowing.
*   **Telecommunications**: Analyze line-of-sight for microwave links or radio towers.
*   **Gap Analysis**: Identify blind spots in existing sensor networks.

## Documentation

For a comprehensive guide on how to use RangePlotter, including configuration details, command reference, and best practices, please see the **[User Guide](docs/guide/index.md)**.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Install
2. Connect your (free) Copernicus account
3. Provide a .kml file (e.g. exported from Google Earth) with one or more placemarks
4. Run './rangeplotter viewshed' to calculate the viewshed around your placemark
5. Import the output .kml file to Google Earth to see your viewshed

## Installation

### Option 1: Standalone Binary (Recommended for Linux Users)
No Python environment required.

1.  **Download** the latest release archive (`rangeplotter_vX.Y.Z_linux.zip`) from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/renwell-studio/rangeplotter/releases).
2.  **Unzip** the archive:
    ```bash
    unzip rangeplotter_vX.Y.Z_linux.zip
    cd rangeplotter_vX.Y.Z_linux
    ```
3.  **Install / Upgrade**:
    Run the included script to set up the executable and preserve your existing configuration if upgrading:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install_or_upgrade.sh
    ./install_or_upgrade.sh
    ```
    *This script will make `rangeplotter` executable and ensure your `config/` and `working_files/` are safe.*
    
    > **Tip:** While the script is designed to be safe, it is always good practice to backup your important files (e.g., `cp config/config.yaml config/config.yaml.backup`) before performing an upgrade. The installer will strictly ignore any files ending in `.bac` or `.backup`.

4.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    ./rangeplotter --help
    ```

### Option 2: Python Wheel (Cross-Platform / Advanced)
For users who have Python installed (Linux, macOS, Windows) and prefer using `pip`.

1.  **Download** the `.whl` file from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/renwell-studio/rangeplotter/releases).
2.  **Install**:
    ```bash
    pip install rangeplotter-0.1.5-py3-none-any.whl
    ```
3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    rangeplotter --help
    ```

### Option 3: Python Source (For Developers)
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/renwell-studio/rangeplotter.git
    cd rangeplotter
    ```
2.  Set up environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -e .
    ```
3.  Run via module:
    ```bash
    python -m rangeplotter.cli.main --help
    ```

## Tech Stack & Methodology

RangePlotter is built on a robust open-source geospatial stack:
*   **Core Engine**: Python 3.12+
*   **Geospatial Processing**: `Rasterio` (GDAL), `Shapely`, `PyProj`.
*   **Terrain Data**: Automatic fetching and caching of **Copernicus GLO-30 DEM** (30m global resolution).
*   **Physics**:
    *   **Adjustable Earth Equivalent Radius Model**: Accounts for atmospheric refraction.
    *   **Azimuthal Equidistant Projection**: Automatically centers calculations on each sensor for high-precision distance measurements.

*   **Bugs**: Include the command run, error output, log contents and a sample KML if possible.
*   **Features**: Describe the use case and desired output.
